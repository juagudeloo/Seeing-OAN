# Seeing-OAN
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) and Python scripts (.py) with the code for calculating seeing using:

    DIMM

        Method 1: Camera defocus
        Method 2: Using a prism
    Deep Field method

        Method 3: Field photos
        
Also, found a code for cenit correction.

The code in the different folders is the same, only different file extension.
